PostCactus -- Postprocessing Tools for Cactus Data
==================================================

This `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ package provides tools to work 
with `CACTUS <http://www.cactuscode.org>`_ data from within scripts or 
interactively. Thanks to the `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org>`_ and 
`h5py <http://www.h5py.org/>`_ libraries, large datasets can be 
processed effectively. It also provides some specialized visualisation 
functions based on `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_. For 
interactive work, we recommend to use `IPython <http://ipython.org/>`_ 
together with Matplotlib.
